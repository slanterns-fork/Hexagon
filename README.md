#Hexagon
Hexagon is a kind of new programming language.
And, It's objective.
It will contains all the cool function and struct.
Maybe I will put it C#-like, but I think C# isn't enough useful.
I'll add a "name pointer" witch can be EXTREAMLY HELPFUL FOR THE PROGRAMMER.
And also "the" the keyword.
It can be used like this:

for(numeric i = new numeric(2), i=+2, i<20)
{
    Container.addControl(Control Ctrl<i> = new Control()); //<> means the pointer
}
printline("Which control do you want to double size?");
j = inputline();
try{
    j = Numeric.parseint(j)
}
catch(NotANumException){
    printline("It's not a integer. Please enter Number.")
}
Container.Children.Ctrl<j>.height =+ the Control.height; //uses <> again
                the Control.width =+ the Control.width;  //uses "the" with class to replace last declared object
                
OK. That's all. Let's go to work.
